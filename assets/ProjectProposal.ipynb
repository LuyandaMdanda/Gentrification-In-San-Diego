    "To us, this question is of big interest because the problem is just onsetting in San Diego. First, gentrification is defined as bringing lower-income areas to a middle-class status. Often this involves developing a city’s infrastructure, but it is mostly just triggered by richer people moving into a certain area. Gentrification, while definitely existent in San Diego, is still new. Census data analyzed by governing.com shows a big growth in gentrification from 2000 to 2010, but it also shows that much of San Diego may still be gentrified. This is concerning to us because of the massive problems the process has caused in the past -- specifically in San Francisco and New York. San Francisco is going through an unprecedented housing crisis right now, and the city’s urban developer seriously worries about getrificaiton’s contributions to this (sfexaminer.com). In addition, we are seeing a large rise in homelessness in San Diego. We see more and more people out on the streets as we walk through downtown, and hear more about it becoming a major problem. The San Diego Tribune has recently confirmed these observations with analysis on the big rise of homelessness, especially in downtown San Diego.\n",
    "\n",
    "As San Diego attempts to grow its economy into what people are hoping is “the next Silicon Valley”, we are seeing the stage being set for San Diego to face similar housing problems that SF is struggling to deal with. We hope to bring some awareness and inspire some caution about where the housing situation of San Diego may be heading. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our hypothesis mainly stems from looking at the factors affecting San Francisco regarding gentrification -- which show that low-income neighborhoods are the most affected. House pricing has been a consistently used measure for the cost of living in an area, and because of the exaggerated effect on low-income areas, we believe the widening income gap will worsen the exaggeration. These two ideas - extrapolated from housing in San Francisco and income in the nation - led to our hypothesis. \n",

    "*Data Cleaning (2-3 sentences)*\n",
    "Since we’re working with multiple data sets (with numerous features), from varying time frames, there is a significant amount of Data Cleaning required in this project. We’ll be dropping columns that we don’t intuitively feel correlate and are unrelated with gentrification, and, moreover, we’ll be merging a few datasets along the timeframe. We also have some data which contains information about nation-wide cities from which we would have to extract required information for San Diego, and the cities we plan to compare San Diego with. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Data Analysis (1-2 paragraphs)*\n",
    "The first step in getting our multiple data sets to work together is by ensuring we look at factor within the same time period. For this issue, we will choose to look at different statistical factors within 1 year by finding the average of each factor within each year. We will use t-test to see the effects of each factor across different regions Then we will begin to correlate different factors to identify if there is a relationship/interaction between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have identified the factors which have a somewhat large correlation to the gentrification related factors, we plan to implement predictive models learnt in class to try fit the data, and further extrapolate the future. This will rely on linear modeling, collinearities between variables, and some dimensionality reduction to deal with the large number of variables given to us by census data. \n",
    "\n",
    "*What to report (2-3 sentences)*\n",
    "We plan to find and report the variables which most strongly correlate with gentrification related negative factors, and its effects across multiple regions in San Diego over a period of several years. We want to extrapolate the situation - in terms of house pricing and population - under which San Diego will be in the near future and, moreover, find feasible solutions to reduce and minimize these factors by identifying factors which could be compromised and changed, possibly through the introduction of new policies.\n",

    "The biggest limitation of our data is that our datasets do not align well with each other in terms of scope. The bulk of our analysis will be off of census data, which provides us a great, detailed snapshot into San Diego in recent years. The number of variables in that dataset and the fine granularity of regions are very useful for making region-by-region analysis with a lot of different possible factors. However, it is only a snapshot into 1 moment in time, and 1 census’ data won’t be great for showing us trends (though some data will be trend related). On the other hand, our second data set, the land prices data, have a great amount of data over several years. However, because this dataset covers cities across the nation, it does not have the granularity of giving us information neighborhood by neighborhood in San Diego. Part of our challenge and limitations will be in combining these and having solid evidence to show trends in regions over the years. We have to be careful not to take general stats (either about a particular year, or about San Diego as a whole area) and apply them too specifically (to multiple years / individual regions).  Combatting this may require the help of other datasets, such as an older census, or zillow housing data by neighborhood. Additionally, census data and crime data will have biases - census data tends to be better collected from certain demographics, while crime data is biased based on police response. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our second concern is our ambitious goal. Ideally, we are trying to use San Diego data to provide a solution to the gentrification problem in this city through prediction. This is especially ambitious because the problem hasn’t fully onset yet. Because of which, there is a fair analysis to be done as to whether certain assumptions we have about contributing factors to displacement hold true. To keep ourselves and our project in check, we want to modularize our goals such that we can take the project as far as we’d ideally want to, while at the same time, having milestones sufficient enough to serve as the project. So, we have broken our overall project into 3 goals as a way to manage the complications. First, we would like to simply identify the gentrification factors with the most impact on displacement and homelessness. Once this is achieved, we can move on to building a model to forecast how the displacement and homelessness problems will continue in the upcoming years. Finally, we hope to show how certain changes will forecast a better future for these issues. If none of these goals are attainable, then at the least, we can settle for showing how the factors of gentrification indeed exist in San Diego, but hopefully we’ll have an answer regarding homelessness and displacement. \n"
